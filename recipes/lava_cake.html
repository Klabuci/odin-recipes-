                <li><strong>INGREDIENTS</strong></li>
            <ul>
            <li>½ cup butter, cut into 8 pieces</li>
            <li>6 ½ (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate, finely chopped</li>
            <li>3 eggs, room temperature</li>
            <li>¼ cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Directions</strong></li>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). 
                    Grease and flour four 6-ounce ramekins.</li>
                <li>Place chocolate and butter in the top of a double boiler over simmering water.
                     Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber 
                    spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Combine eggs and sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer
                     until pale and thick, about 5 minutes. Mix in melted chocolate, 
                     cocoa powder, and flour until combined. Pour batter into the 
                     prepared ramekins and place on a baking tray.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the sides are set but the middle is
                     still jiggly, 10 to 13 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes before 
                     serving.</li>
            </ol>
        </ul>
